### Featured Project

#### [Nexus — Jamf EA Dependency Analyzer](https://github.com/MUMO97/nexus)

> Know exactly which Extension Attributes are safe to delete — before you touch anything.

Native macOS app that connects to Jamf Pro and maps every Extension Attribute dependency across **9 object types** — Smart Groups, Advanced Searches, Policies, Config Profiles, Restricted Software, Patch Policies, and all three mobile equivalents.

**What it does:**
- Scans 200+ EAs in parallel and classifies each as Safe / In Use / Orphaned
- Shows a visual dependency graph per EA with script preview
- Bulk delete with in-use warnings and export-before-delete safety prompt
- Generates a professional HTML cleanup report for Confluence
- Covers both Computer and Mobile Device Extension Attributes
- Scan result caching — instant UI on reconnect

Built in SwiftUI. Free to use for Mac Admins.
